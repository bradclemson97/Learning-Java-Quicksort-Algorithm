# Learning-Java-Quicksort-Algorithm

Quicksort algorithms work in 3 steps:
    * 1. choose one of the numbers in your array as the 'pivot' - it's better to choose it at random.
    * 2. partitioning - move all numbers in the array lower than the pivot to the left of it and all number higher to the right of it.
    * 3. recursively quicksort all-of the values to the left and right of the pivot.
